Tamias2D: A 2D Rigid body Game Physics Library (Source Code)


Dependencies:
The following needs to be installed to run Tamias2D:

1. Python3
2. Download all the files in Tamias2D folder
3. 
pip install -e .

 
(include the dot after e)- This should install the package and all of the dependencies.

Run Tamias2D:
There are example files created that can be run:

*PlotDemo.py simulates the collision of 3 bodies and it computes
the history of the position, velocity and angular velocity where applicable.
*Right click on PlotDemo.py and click run to run the file
It generates the result in the console and generates a graph of velocity 
over time and position over time. 


*Unit tests are provided in tests\test_unit.py. To run it, 
click Run=>Run from the top toolbar, then choose “pytest for test_unit.py”
if you see the option. All the tests clear with no errors.

* output.py is used for outputting to the console and activating the plotter
when the time is right. Plotting is handled in plotter.py and it displays 
the graphs based on the specified parameters e.g graph of position over time,
velocity over time e.t.c. In output.py, an enumerator class is defined to make
choosing what values to display easier. The enumerator is called Options. And 
can be used as a constant so no misspelling happens.
	
Class Options(Enum)
	POSITION = ‘’position”
	ROTATION = “rotation”
	VELOCITY = “velocity”
	ANGVEL = “angularVel”
	FORCE = “force”
	TORQUE = “torque”
	ACCEL = “accel”
	ANGACCEL = “angAccel”

The above is used alongside another class called OutputOptions, which 
contains a dictionary that has all the keys from the enumerators paired 
with a Boolean value. 

Class Options(Enum)
	Options.POSITION = “False”
	Options.ROTATION = “False”
	Options.VELOCITY = “False”
	Options.ANGVEL = “False”
	Options.FORCE = “False”
	Options.TORQUE = “False”
	Options.ACCEL = “False”
	Options.ANGACCEL = “False”
If you want any of the above values to be outputted for the test 
you’re executing, just enable it using the key. For example:
opt = OutputOptions()
opt.enable_option(Options.POSITION)
opt.enable_option(Options.VELOCITY)
output.options = opt
