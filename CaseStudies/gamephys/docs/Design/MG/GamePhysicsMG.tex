\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  In the best practices for scientific computing,
\citet{WilsonEtAl2013} advise a modular design, but are silent on the criteria
to use to decompose the software into modules.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}. This principle
supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module hides
represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC, where
modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.

Our design follows the rules laid out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is used in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

\noindent After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change. Anticipated changes are numbered by \textbf{AC} followed by a number.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
  hardware on which the software is running.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acBody}:] The data structure of the
physical properties of an object such as the object's mass, position and velocity.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acShape}:] The data structure of the
surface properties of an object such as the object's elasticity/ Coefficient of restitution.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSpace}:] How all the rigid
bodies and shapes interact together.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acCollision}:] The data structure containing collision information such as the objects that collide and their mass. 
%\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acControl}:] How the overall
  %control of the simulation is orchestrated, including the input and output of data.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acVector}:] The implementation of mathematical vectors.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acBBox}:] The implementation of bounding box structures.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSolver}:] The algorithm used for solving collisions.

\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.  Unlikely changes are numbered by \textbf{UC}
followed by a number.

\begin{description}
%\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
 % (Input: Keyboard and/or mouse, Output: Memory and/or Screen).
 % \\olu: removed UC1
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] There will always be a source of input data external to the software.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucOutput}:] Output data are
  displayed to the output device.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucGoal}:] The goal of the system is to simulate the interactions of 2D rigid bodies.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucCartesian}:] A Cartesian 
coordinate system is used.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucRigid}:] All objects
are rigid bodies.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{uc2D}:] All objects
are 2D.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.  Modules are numbered by \textbf{M}
followed by a number.

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Hardware-Hiding 
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mBody}:] Rigid Body 
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mShape}:] Shape 
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mCircle}:] Circle
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mPoly}:] Polygon
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mSpace}:] Space  
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mVector}:] Vector
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mSolver}:] Collision Solver 
\end{description}
\noindent
Note that \mref{mHH} is a commonly used module and is already implemented by the operating
system.  It will not be reimplemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}
The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating system or by standard programming language libraries. If the entry is \emph{\progname}, this means that the module will be implemented by the game physics library.  
% should reference a command for the name, in case it changes
If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means
that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or
not this module is implemented depends on the programming language
selected.
If a module has a children section, the modules listed will inherit from  
this module. Both the parent and the children modules will be implemented.

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements, and between the modules and the anticipated changes. We should also consider documenting the mapping between these ``abstract" modules and the implemented code files.

That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct implementation of B.  Figure \ref{Fig_uses} illustrates the use relation between the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler because they use modules from the lower levels.
