Some aspects of physics are very useful in computer games development hence, most of the popular games on the market
today would never be successful without a good physics engine.Game physics libraries are used to simulate physical
phenomena in objects e.g a physics library can be used to simulate collision between 2 objects in a game. It can be an
arduous task in game developmemt to create a game physics library from scratch,and if not included may result to sub-standard game products.
If there are more affordable/free open source game physics library on the market, game developers would be able to incorporate them in their products producing high quality game products.

The purpose of this software is to create a fast, easy to use and portable game physics library for simulation of 2D rigid 
bodies that can be used by game developers in their products.
