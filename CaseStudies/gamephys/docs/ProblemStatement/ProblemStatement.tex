Some aspects of physics are very useful in video game development and most of
the popular games on the market today would never be successful without a good
physics engine. Game physics libraries are used to simulate physical phenomena
in objects e.g collision between two objects in a game. It can be an arduous
task in game development to create a game physics library from scratch, and if
not included in game products, might result in sub-standard video games. If
there are more affordable/free open source game physics library on the market,
game developers would be able to include them in their products, producing high
quality video games. Chipmunk2D (https://chipmunk-physics.net/) is an example of
a physics library widely used in 2D physics games, similar to this project.

The purpose of this software is to create a fast, easy to use and portable game
physics library for simulation of 2D rigid bodies. This library will be used to
simulate how two-dimensional rigid bodies interact with one another when they
are acted upon by a force as well as predict the time history of each objects'
position and orientation.
