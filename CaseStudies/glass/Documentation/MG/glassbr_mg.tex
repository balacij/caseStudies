\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  In the best practices for scientific computing,
\citet{WilsonEtAl2013} advise a modular design, but are silent on the criteria
to use to decompose the software into modules.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is used in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. 
The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it is can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change. %Anticipated changes are numbered by \textbf{AC} followed by a number.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
  hardware on which the software is running.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format of the
  initial input data.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acParams}:] The format of the
  input parameters.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acOutput}:] The format of the
  final output data.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acCalc}:] How the equations are 
defined using the input parameters.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acControl}:] How the overall
  control of the calculations is orchestrated.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acIntData}:] The format of the 
data used for interpolation.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInt}:] The algorithm used
  for interpolation.

\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decisions should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.  As an example, the equations for calculating the 
blast risk  are assumed to follow the structure given in the SRS; that is,
even if they need to be modified, the modifications should be possible by
changing how the input parameters are used in the definition.  If new parameters
are needed, this will mean a change to both the input parameters module, the
calculation module and the output module.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] There will always be
  a source of input data external to the software.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucOutput}:] Output data are
  displayed to the output device.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucGoal}:] The goal of the system
  is to predict whether the glass slab under consideration can withstand an 
  explosion of a certain degree.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucODEstructure}:] The 
equations for Safety can be defined using parameters defined in the input parameters 
module.

\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}


This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Hardware-Hiding Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mInput}:] Input Format Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mParams}:] Input Parameters Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mConstraints}:] Input 
	Constraints Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mOutput}:] Output Format Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mDerVal}:]  Derived Values Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mCalc}:]  Calculations Module
\item[\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mControl}:]  Control Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mIntData}:] Interpolation Data 
	Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mInt}:] Interpolation Module

\end{description}

Note that \mref{mHH} is a commonly used module and is already implemented by 
the operating system.  It will not be reimplemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries. If the entry is
\emph{Python}, this means that the module is provided by Python.  
\emph{Glass-BR} means the module will be implemented by the Glass-BR software.  
% should reference a command for the name, in case it changes
Only the leaf modules in the
hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means
that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or
not this module is implemented depends on the programming language
selected.

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.  We should
also consider documenting the mapping between these ``abstract'' modules and the
Python files.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.
