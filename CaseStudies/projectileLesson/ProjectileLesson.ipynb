To take into account that Section 12.6 builds on the previous sections, I've added an initial section that simply provides a summary of the equations that were previously derived.  The derivation of these equations is fairly similar to how they are derived in the current Projectile example in Drasil.

    "The free flight motion of a projectile is often studied in terms of its rectangular components, since the projectile's acceleration *always* acts in the vertical direciton.  To illustrate the kinematic analysis, consider a projectile launched at point $(x^i, y^i)$, as shown in Figure [hyperref here?].  The path is defined in the $x-y$ plane such that the initial velocity is $\\mathbf{v}^i$, having components $v_x^i$ and $v_y^i$.  When air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the projectile is its weight, which causes the projectile to have a *constant downward acceleration* of approximately $a^c = g = 9.81 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$ or $g = 32.2 \\text{ft}/\\text{s}^2$.[^1] [footnotes don't seem to be working on my Mac?]\n",
