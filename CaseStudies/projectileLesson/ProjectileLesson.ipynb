    "The free flight motion of a projectile is often studied in terms of its rectangular components, since the projectile's acceleration *always* acts in the vertical direciton.  To illustrate the kinematic analysis, consider a projectile launched at point $(x^i, y^i)$, as shown in Figure [hyperref here?].  The path is defined in the $x-y$ plane such that the initial velocity is $\\mathbf{v}^i$, having components $v_x^i$ and $v_y^i$.  When air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the projectile is its weight, which causes the projectile to have a *constant downward acceleration* of approximately $a^c = g = 9.81 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$ or $g = 32.2 \\text{ft}/\\text{s}^2$.[^1] [footnotes don't seem to be working on my Mac?]\n",

    "Free-flight projectile motion problems can be solved using the following procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish the fixed $x$, $y$ coordinate axes and sketch the trajectory of the particle.  Between any *two points* on the path specify the given problem data and the *three unknowns*.  In all cases the acceleration of gravity acts downward.  The particle's initial and final velocities should be represented in terms of their $x$ and $y$ components.\n",
    "- Remember that positive and negative position, velocity, and acceleration components always act in accordance with their associated coordinate directions.\n",
    "- The two points that are selected should be significant points where something about the motion of the particle is known.  Potential significant points include the initial point of launching the projectile and the final point where it lands. The landing point often has a known $y$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kinematic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending upon the known data and what is to be determined, a choice should be made as to which three of the following four equations should be applied between the two points on the path to obtain the most direct solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *velocity* in the horizontal or $x$ direction is *constant*, i.e., $v_x = v_x^i$, and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_x = p_x^i + v_x^i t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertical Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the vertical or $y$ direction *only two* of the following three equations can be used for solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Eq_rectVel](#mjx-eqn-Eq_rectVel): $v = v^i + a^c t$\n",
    "\n",
    "[Eq_rectPos](#mjx-eqn-Eq_rectPos): $p = p^i + v^i t + \\frac{1}{2} a^c t^2$\n",

    "[Eq_rectNoTime](#mjx-eqn-Eq_rectNoTime): $v^2 = (v^i)^2 + 2 a^c (p - p^i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if the particle's final velocity $v_y$ is not needed, then the first and third of these questions (for $y$) will not be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "[There are actually 5 equations (4 independent equations), but the one about velocity in the horizontal direction being constant isn't included in Hibbler's list of 4 equations.  He mentions it, but doesn't consider it a separate equation.]\n",
    "\n",
    "[The general view of projecile problems has 10 variables: $p_x, p_y, v_x, v_y, p_x^i, p_y^i, v_x^i, v_y^i, a_c, t$.  There are 4 independent equations (we don't need [Eq_rectNoTime](#mjx-eqn-Eq_rectNoTime), since it is derived from the other equations).  However, solving projectile motion problems isn't as simple as solving for 4 unknowns from 4 equations, since the equations aren't all coupled.  For instance, if there are three unknowns of $p_x, v_x^i$ and $v_x$, there is no way to solve for the unknowns, despite having 4 equations.  It doesn't seem to be an option to exhaustively go through all of the cases, since there are 10 choose 4, or 210 cases.  Some of the 210 aren't solvable.  The textbooks tend to focus on problems inspired by real engineering problems, so $a_c$ is usually set to g or 0.  Even in this case there are 9 choose 4, or 126 combinations. ]\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Drasil viewpoint of the family can be that everything up to the instance model is mostly common to all examples.  The instance model is where the specific equations are selected and rearranged to solve for the unknowns.]"
