    "# 12.6 Motion of a Projectile\n",
    "\n",
    "The free flight motion of a projectile is often studied in terms of its rectangular components, since the projectile's acceleration *always* acts in the vertical direciton.  To illustrate the kinematic analysis, consider a projectile launched at point $(x_0, y_0)$, as shown in Figure (hyperref here?).  The path is defined in the $x-y$ plane such that the initial velocity is $\\mathbf{v}_0$, having components $v_x^i$ and $v_y^i$.  When air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the projectile is its weight, which causes the projectile to have a *constant downward acceleration* of approximately $a^c = g = 9.81 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$ or $g = 32.2 \\text{ft}/\\text{s}^2$.[^1] (footnotes don't seem to be working on my Mac?)\n",
