This folder contains the scripts for the reimplemented program.

 - Scripts with an /SSA_ name are testing files. Scripts without this are the program files.

 - To run the program open the Control.m script and run.

 - To compile the testing document open the SSA_TesterMain.m program and run. BEWARE : running the entire document may take over 30 minutes). A better soloution is to just run the publish command for the scripts that need to be updated by cutting and pasting the respective commands found in SSA_TesterMain. If recompiling the SSA_TesterMain document it must be run with the 'evalCode' option set to false.
