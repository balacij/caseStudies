\noindent This document outlines the system verification and validation plan 
for the software. General information regarding the system under test and the 
objectives of the verification and validation activities is provided in Section 
\ref{sec_GenInfo}. Overviews of verification plans for the SRS, design, and 
implementation are given in Section \ref{sec_Plan}, along with a summary of the 
validation plan for the software. Section \ref{sec_System} details specific  
system test cases for verifying the requirements outlined in Section 
\ref{SRS-sec_Reqs} of the SRS. A summary of planned static verification 
activities can be found in Section \ref{sec_Static} of this document.

\section{General Information} \label{sec_GenInfo}

\subsection{Summary}

\noindent The software being tested is the Slope Stability Analysis Program 
(\progname{}). Based on user-defined slope geometry and material properties, 
\progname{} determines the critical slip surface of the given slope, the 
corresponding factor of safety, and interslice normal and shear forces along 
the critical slip surface.

\subsection{Objectives}

\noindent The purpose of the verification and validation activities is to 
confirm that \progname{} exhibits desired software qualities. The primary 
objective is to build confidence in the correctness of the software. The tests 
described in this document cannot definitively prove correctness, but they can 
build confidence by verifying that the software is correct for the cases 
covered by tests. Other important qualities to be verified are the 
understandability, maintainability, and reusability of the software.

\subsection{References}

\noindent Extensive information about the purpose and requirements of 
\progname{} can be found in the SRS document. This System VnV Plan is 
complemented by the System VnV Report, where the results of the tests planned 
in this document are discussed. For more details on test cases specific to the 
implementation of \progname{}, consult the Unit VnV Plan document. The latest 
documentation for \progname{} can be found on GitHub, at \newline 
\href{https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/master/CaseStudies/ssp}{https://github.com/smiths/caseStudies/tree/master/CaseStudies/ssp}.

\section{Plan} \label{sec_Plan}
	
\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\noindent Brooks MacLachlan is responsible for the verification and validation 
of \progname{}, though input from various students and the professor, Dr. 
Spencer 
Smith, of CAS 741 will also contribute.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\noindent SRS verification will be carried out by reviews. Brooks MacLachlan 
will extensively review the SRS, including reviewing the sources to confirm 
that the theories and models described in the SRS are correct. Any issues 
identified during this review will be fixed immediately by Brooks MacLachlan. 
This review will be followed up by additional reviews by Dr. Spencer Smith and 
Vajiheh Motamer, a student in CAS 741. Any issues identified by these reviewers 
will be recorded through the issue tracker on GitHub, and addressed by Brooks 
MacLachlan. Brooks MacLachlan will also informally present the SRS to the 
entire class of CAS 741. Any issues discovered during this presentation will be 
subsequently fixed by Brooks MacLachlan. A focus of these reviews will be to 
verify the non-functional requirements of correctness and understandability by 
identifying information in the SRS that is incorrect or ambiguous.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\noindent The design of \progname{} is outlined in the Module Guide (MG) and 
Module Interface Specification (MIS) documents. The design will be verified by 
review of these documents. Brooks MacLachlan will extensively review both 
documents. To verify correctness, part of this review will be to ensure that 
every module traces to a requirement and that every requirement is traced to by 
a module. To evaluate the modularity of the design, "uses" relationships 
between modules will be examined to ensure modules do not mutually use each 
other. The review will also check that each module hides exactly one secret. 
Ensuring the program is well-modularized contributes to verification of the 
non-functional requirements of maintainability and reusability. Any issues 
identified during these reviews will be fixed immediately by Brooks MacLachlan. 
Dr. Spencer Smith will also review both documents. An additional review will be 
conducted by students in CAS 741: Karol Serkis for the MG and Malavika 
Srinivasan for the MIS. Any issues identified by these reviews will be recorded 
through the issue tracker on GitHub, and addressed by Brooks 
MacLachlan. Brooks MacLachlan will also informally present the MG to the entire 
class of CAS 741. Any design issues discovered during this presentation will be 
subsequently fixed by Brooks MacLachlan. Reviews of these design documents will 
also focus on ensuring understandability by identifying descriptions and 
specifications that are ambiguous.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan} \label{sec_ImpPlan}

\noindent The implementation of \progname{} will be verified by review and by 
testing. Brooks MacLachlan will extensively review the implementation. Any 
issues identified during these reviews will be fixed immediately by Brooks 
MacLachlan. This review will be followed up by reviews by Dr. Spencer Smith and 
Robert White, a student in CAS 741. Any  issues identified by these reviews 
will be recorded through the issue tracker on GitHub, and addressed by Brooks 
MacLachlan. Brooks MacLachlan will also informally present the implementation 
to the entire class of CAS 741. Any implementation issues discovered during 
this presentation will be subsequently fixed by Brooks MacLachlan. These 
reviews will contribute to verifying correctness and understandability of the 
software by identifying code that is not traceable to any specifications 
described in the SRS, MG, or MIS.
\newline

\noindent The implementation will also be verified by testing. Specific test 
cases are outlined in Section \ref{sec_System} of this document. Test cases 
that are directly dependent on implementation details are outlined in an 
accompanying document, the Unit VnV Plan. All tests will be written (where 
applicable), reviewed, executed, and reported on by Brooks MacLachlan.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There is no validation plan for \progname{}.

\section{System Test Description} \label{sec_System}

The values in Table~\ref{ExValidInputs} will be used as input for 
many of the test cases described throughout this section. These values were 
taken from the User's Guide for this project by \cite{UserGuide}. Individual 
test cases will reference the table as input but specify new values for any 
input parameter that should have a different value than specified by the table.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Invalid User Input}

~\newline \noindent The test cases described in Table~\ref{FaultyInputTests} 
are intended to cover all invalid input possibilities. Invalid input is input 
that defies the data constraints described in Section 
\ref{SRS-sec_DataConstraints} of the SRS. These test cases are identical to 
each other with the exception of their input. The input for each is specified 
in Table~\ref{FaultyInputTests}. For each test case, the inputs not specified 
in this table are specified in Table~\ref{ExValidInputs}. The control method 
for these test cases is automatic. The initial state for each is a new session. 
The expected output is the generation of an exception. The tests will be 
performed as automated tests on a unit testing framework.

\subsubsection{Calculation Tests}

The tests in this section verify that \progname{} correctly determines critical 
slip surfaces and calculates factors of safety by comparing results obtained 
from \progname{} to results reported in literature or results obtained by the 
original version of \progname{} for some specific example problems. In each 
test case, the sources to compare to are specified.

all 10 vertices together. The critical slip surface calculated by the original 
version of SSP is shown in Figure~\ref{OrigProgSlip}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements} \label{sec_NFRTests}

\subsubsection{Maintainability test}

\begin{enumerate}[label=TC\arabic*:,ref={\arabic*}]
	
\item [TC\refstepcounter{testnum}\thetestnum: \label{TC_Maintainability}] 
test-maintainability

Type: Manual
					
Initial State: Test subject has a completed MG for \progname{}
					
Input/Condition: MG for \progname{} and the following question "If you were 
tasked with modifying \progname{} to accept an imposed surface load as an input 
and incorporate this additional force into the computation, which module(s) 
would you change?"
					
Output/Result: Input Module, Input Verification Module, Calculation Module

\bmac{Subject to change since design has not been completed yet}
					
How test will be performed: Test subject will be asked the question described 
in "Input/Condition" and must answer only by consulting the MG. Their answer 
will be recorded and compared with the correct answer outlined in 
"Output/Result". If the subject answers correctly, the test passes and 
confidence in the maintainability of \progname{} is increased. If the subject 
answers incorrectly, the test fails and the documentation or implementation of 
\progname{} must be updated to be more maintainable.
					
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reusability test}

\begin{enumerate}[label=TC\arabic*:,ref={\arabic*}]
	
\item [TC\refstepcounter{testnum}\thetestnum: \label{TC_Reusability}] 
test-reusability

Type: Manual

Initial State: There is a completed implementation of \progname{}
	
Input/Condition: Code that prompts the user for command-line inputs related to 
slope stability analysis.

Output/Result: An alternative version of \progname{} that uses the input code. 
All modules in the alternative version should be identical to the existing 
\progname{} modules, with the exception of the Input Module.

How test will be performed: The alternative version of \progname{} will be 
developed by Brooks MacLachlan. If only the Input Module is changed from the 
existing version, then the test passes and confidence in the reusability of 
\progname{}'s modules is increased. If other modules need to be changed, the 
test fails and the other modules must be modified to be completely reusable.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\noindent The purpose of the traceability matrix shown in 
Table~\ref{Table:T_trace} is to provide easy 
references on which requirements are verified by which test cases, and which 
test cases need to be updated if a requirement changes.  If a requirement is 
changed, the items in the column of that requirement that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.
