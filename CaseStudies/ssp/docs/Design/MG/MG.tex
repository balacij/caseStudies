\section{Introduction}

\hspace{3ex}Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted
approach to developing software.  A module is a work assignment for a
programmer or programming team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  In the best
practices for Scientific Computing (SC), \citet{WilsonEtAl2013} advise a
modular design, but are silent on the criteria to use to decompose the
software into modules.  We advocate a decomposition based on the
principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This principle
supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable
in SC, where modifications are frequent, especially during initial
development as the solution space is explored.

Our design follows the rules laid out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}  
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be
  the secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's
  data structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging
  to that module.
\end{itemize}

In a rational design process, the Module Guide (MG) is developed after 
completing the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 
\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG specifies the modular
structure of the system and is intended to allow both designers and
maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new
  project member to easily understand the overall structure and
  quickly find the relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide
  improves the maintainers' understanding when they need to make
  changes to the system. It is important for a maintainer to update
  the relevant sections of the document after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be
  used to check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can 
  verify the system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, 
  feasibility of the decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the
software requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module
hierarchy that was constructed according to the likely
changes. Section \ref{SecConnection} specifies the connections between
the software requirements and the modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a
detailed description of the modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two
traceability matrices. One checks the completeness of the design
against the requirements provided in the SRS. The other shows the
relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

\hspace{3ex}This section lists possible changes to Slope Stability analysis 
Program (\progname{}). According to the likeliness of the change, the possible
changes are classified into two categories. Each Anticipated Change (AC) is
listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and each Unlikely Change (UC) is listed in
Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

\hspace{3ex}Anticipated changes are the source of the information that
is to be hidden inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the
anticipated changes will only require changing the one module that
hides the associated decision. The approach adapted here is called
design for change.

  specific hardware on which the software is running.

\item[AC\refstepcounter{acnum}\theacnum \label{AC_Plot}:] The method
  for creating plots.
\end{description}


\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

\hspace{3ex}The module design should be as general as
possible. However, a general system is more complex. Sometimes this
complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design decisions at the
system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If these
decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the
design will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended
that these decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{ucnum}UC\theucnum \label{UC_IO}:] Input/Output
  devices (Input: File and/or keyboard, Output: File, memory, and/or
  screen).
\item [\refstepcounter{ucnum}UC\theucnum \label{UC_SSPGoal}:] The goals of 
\progname{}, to determine a slope's critical slip surface and corresponding 
factor of safety, will not change.
 
\end{description}


\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

\hspace{3ex}This section provides an overview of the module
design. Modules are summarized in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets
in Table~\ref{Table:Decomp}. The modules listed below are the modules
that will actually be implemented. Modules are numbered by \textbf{M}
followed by a number.

implemented by the Operating System (OS).

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the
requirements developed in the SRS. In this stage, the system is
decomposed into modules. The connection between requirements and
modules is listed in Table~\ref{Table:Req}. To meet the requirements for 
generating and optimizing potential slip surfaces to find the critical slip 
surface, \rref{SRS-R_InitGen} and \rref{SRS-R_Minimize}, the design decision to 
use a genetic algorithm was made. Further information on use of a genetic 
algorithm in relation to a slope stability problem can be found in 
\cite{LiEtAl}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

\hspace{3ex}Modules are decomposed according to the principle of
``information hiding'' proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The
\emph{Secrets} field in a module decomposition is a brief statement of
the design decision hidden by the module. The \emph{Services} field
specifies \emph{what} the module will do without documenting
\emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By}
title. If the entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is
provided by the operating system or by standard programming language
libraries. If the entry is \emph{\progname}, the module will be implemented by 
\progname. Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a 
dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will 
not have to be implemented. Whether or not this module is implemented depends 
on the programming language selected.

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

\hspace{3ex}This section shows two traceability matrices: Table~\ref{Table:Req} 
shows which modules cover each Requirement (R) and Table~\ref{Table:AC} shows 
how modules map to the anticipated changes. There are two cases where a single 
module covers multiple anticipated changes. \acref{AC_input} and 
\acref{AC_inputConstraints} are both covered by \mref{mInput}, and 
\acref{AC_output} and \acref{AC_outputConstraints} are both covered by 
\mref{mOutput}. In these cases, the anticipated changes are related to two 
services that should always happen in tandem. If input is being read, it should 
always be verified. If output is being delivered, it should always be verified. 
Thus, it makes sense to combine the two services into a single module.

While the division of a slip surface into vertical slices and the calculation 
of properties of each slice are part of the Morgenstern-Price method, they have 
been separated into their own modules, \mref{mSlipSlicer} and 
\mref{mSliceProperty}. This is due to \acref{AC_CalcFS}, as these modules would 
be common between different methods for calculating the factor of safety. Due 
to this decision, \mref{mMorgPrice} is the only module associated with 
\acref{AC_CalcFS}, as can be seen in Table~\ref{Table:AC}.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

\hspace{3ex}In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \cite{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em
  uses} B if correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete
the task described in its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if
there exist situations in which the correct functioning of A depends
upon the availability of a correct implementation of B. 
Figure~\ref{Fig_Use} illustrates the use hierarchy between the modules. The
graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each level of the hierarchy
offers a testable and usable subset of the system, and modules in the
higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler because they use
modules from the lower levels.

\wss{I doubt we'll need them, but we might decide to introduce a module to
  define new data types for the tuples that define the given slope stability
  problem. We definitely shouldn't do it now, but if things get complicated
  looking, we can add it later.}
